# bad-apple-html
Bad Apple!! in pure HTML, no CSS or JS, since I don't think that's been done yet. It's kinda terrible but it works so eh, good enough. Maybe I'll try make it better later.

iframe test: this branch uses an iframe to load the video while the audio is on the real page that doesn't redirect. much smoother, 12-15 FPS, but almost impossible to actually sync the audio and video since you have no real control over how long a frame is.
